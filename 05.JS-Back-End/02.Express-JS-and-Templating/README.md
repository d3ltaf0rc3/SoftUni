Setup:

1. npm install - to install all dependencies
2. add your MongoDB url in config.js (I strongly recommend you use node env variables for the user and password)
3. set node env variables "DB_USER" and "DB_PASSWORD", otherwise mongoose won't connect
4. npm run start - to run the web server locally
5. open - localhost:3000
